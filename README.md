# Submitting updates to offsets after patch
~~CE can be downloaded here: http://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php~~

~~This guide assumes 6.5: http://www.cheatengine.org/download/CheatEngine65NoSetup.rar~~

~~It should work with any version, but options may be named differently~~

## Quick guide if you're more familiar with CE
~~1. In CE: File - Open process.  for DX9: ffxiv.exe, DX11: ffxiv_dx11.exe~~

~~2. In game: Zoom all the way out, make sure there are no obstructions~~

~~3. In CE: On the right side, change Value Type to Float.  Look for Value 20.0~~

~~4. In game: Zoom all the way in without going to first person~~

~~5. In CE: Change Value to 1.5, hit enter or click "Next Scan"~~

~~6. Repeat steps 2-5 until you see the value of interest in the window on the left.  You should see the value changing as you change zoom in game.~~

~~7. In CE: Double click the value in the top, this adds it to the list on the bottom.~~

~~8. In CE: Right-click on the address on the bottom, click "find what writes to this address"~~

~~9. In game: Zoom in and out a few times, CE should update with an instruction in the new new window.~~

~~10. In CE:~~

~~  1. Select the instruction~~

~~  2. Look for the line which does the writing, it will have '<<' at the end~~

~~  3. Look for the register and offset, you should see something like DX9: [ecx+000000F8], DX11: [r9+00000000000000F8] (note: it's been RCX before)~~

~~  4. Find the address in the register, at the bottom look for ECX=0125BB80.  Save this address, clipboard or notepad.~~

~~  5. Get back to the main CE window~~

~~11. In CE: Click "New Scan", Value Type DX9: 4 Bytes, DX11: 8 Bytes, check Hex.  Search~~

~~12. In CE: Top list should show multiple results, for all green ones do this until something makes sense:~~

~~  1. Double-click the address in the top~~

~~  2. Double-click the address in the bottom that appears, make sure to click on the 'Address' value~~

~~  3. Copy the address, DX9: ffxiv.exe+offset, DX11: ffxiv_dx11.exe+offset~~

~~  4. Check Pointer, change Type to Float~~

~~  5. Paste the address in the box above "Add Offset", click OK~~

~~  6. If the Value is displayed as a hex: Right-click the row in the bottom, click "show as decimal"~~

~~  7. Ensure that value updates as you zoom~~

~~You have now found the offset.  Modify the Offset.xml, the offset from above (after ffxiv.exe or ffxiv_dx11.exe)is the StructureAddress in the xml.~~
